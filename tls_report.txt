
TLS Handshake Overview:

The client initiates communication by sending a ClientHello message, listing the encryption algorithms (cipher suites) it supports.

The server answers with a ServerHello, selecting a cipher suite and providing its digital certificate.

The client checks the authenticity of the certificate using a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

A secure key exchange follows, leading to the creation of an encrypted session.

How TLS Defends Against MITM Attacks:

Digital certificates confirm the identity of the server.

The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system ensures certificates are validated by recognized CAs.

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) guarantees that fresh encryption keys are generated for every session, limiting the impact if a key is compromised.

TLS Role in HTTPS:

HTTPS employs TLS to secure HTTP traffic.

It guarantees privacy, data integrity, and authentication when users interact with websites.

TLS protects web communication from eavesdropping, data manipulation, and identity spoofing.
